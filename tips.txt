1.We have all of the information we need. Manahttan let's us simplify things by considering a case where 
a storage may store more than one box satisfying its own restriction. ie a storage can only store boxes with
certrain labels. Hence, consider the three information only: box location, storage location and restriction. 




2.Using the three information from above, find all the possible moves each box can make to be stored in its own 
proper storage space. 

3.To figure out where each box is able to be stored due to restriction, we may store the box_labels into a different
array and use them later to see if any restriction was imposed. If not, we may store the boxes anywhere we like. 

4.To minimize the cost, geometrically this will become equivalent to using the storage space where the L2 norm, 
or the distance to that box to the storage space of interest is minimal. This is simple pythagorus. 

5.Utlize this the information by considering exactly which box was moved to which storage space giving the minimal 
by using a loop and terminate by adding all the |delta(x)| and |delta(y)| distance giving the Manhattan.
